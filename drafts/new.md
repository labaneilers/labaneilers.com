After my first few years working in software, I figured I was a pretty decent programmer. I felt like, with just a couple years of practice, especially given that I had taught myself to program, I performed pretty well compared to other programmers I worked with. In a couple more years, with some achievements under my belt, I felt confident I was pretty darn good at this.

In the intervening 25 years, I've gained a lot more experience, built a bunch of cool stuff, developed tons of skills, added a whole bunch of tools to my toolbelt. I've learned like 10 or so languages (or depending on what you call a language, a bunch more), and I've been able to solve most technical problems I've been presented with.

With the benefit of this perspective, I'm now sure that I'm actually a pretty mediocre programmer.

* working with PhD wizards
* plumbers vs city planners
* The wizards build raw capabilities, and I find a way to combine them into a product

* Tight integration with the companies centralized systems:
  * identity provider
  * docker registries 
  * observability stack
  * 
* A flexible configuration management system that allows teams define arbitrary environments
* Transparent mapping of configuration to local Docker, Kubernetes, and IDE debuggers
* Local-first tooling, enabling decoupling from the CI/CD system
* Ephemeral environments for branches
* Ability to define custom CLI commands with arbitrary (imperative) code
* A pipeline of client-side Kubernetes object transforms to enable "golden path" patterns easy (e.g. Ingress, )
