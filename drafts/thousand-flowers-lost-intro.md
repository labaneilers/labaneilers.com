I've been working with my colleague EJ on setting up a new team at work; we're splitting a new Developer Experience team out of our pre-existing Cloud Engineering team (which I'm very excited about). He's the actual, official manager of the Cloud Engineering team (which I've been working closely with over the past couple years). I've been a sort of guest on the team, though I'm in all the ceremonies, work out of their JIRA board, and try to follow their working agreements.

A few years ago, I made a deliberate decision to step away from managing teams directly, but I'm also not strictly an individual contributor. I'm pretty lucky to have a role where I'm expected to have an organization-scoped impact, without having to do people management. Given this outsized influence, I have to be careful not to suck up too much oxygen within my host team; its really important to me that everyone feels empowered, trusted, and comfortable to throw out crazy ideas (often the best kind of ideas). I also want to make sure I'm using my influence to support the team manager and help him succeed.

## OK, sometimes it just comes out

On the other hand, I sometimes have strong opinions. I try to be fairly gentle when expressing them, but particularly so when it has to do with team health, work management, or other areas where the team's manager is ultimately accountable. I have a personal policy that I'm allowed to share an idea or observation, but I try to limit my follow-up/advocacy for it unless the team is actively expressing interest.

:::warning
I often fail at adhering to my own policy. This is something I'm trying to do better at.

While doing some preparation for the new DevX team, EJ and I been talking a lot about Kanban vs Scrum, optimizing for lead time, and the role of the agile coach/scrum master in day-to-day operations. He's spent most of his career doing a fairly specific flavor of Scrum, and has a mix of curiosity and skepticism about venturing away from the methodologies that have worked for him in the past.

Some of the points I was making to EJ seemed to be inducing some reservations (and perhaps triggering some past trauma). I had the sense that he thought I was regurgitating some tidbit from a bullshit management article, or otherwise overselling my intuitions. It took me a second to remember that, a few years back, I had a fairly unusual experience that has colored my perspective on engineering management, and I hadn't shared it with him.
