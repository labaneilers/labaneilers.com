I've been working with a colleague on setting up a new team at work; we're splitting a new Developer Experience team out of our pre-existing Cloud Engineering team (which I'm very excited about). He's the actual, official manager of the Cloud Engineering team (which I've been working closely with over the past couple years). I've been a sort of guest on the team, though I'm in all the ceremonies, work out of their JIRA board, and try to follow their working agreements.

A few years ago, I made a deliberate decision to step away from managing teams directly, but I'm also not strictly an individual contributor. I'm pretty lucky to have a role where I'm expected to have an organization-scoped impact, without having to do people management. Given this outsized influence, I have to be careful not to suck up too much oxygen within my host team; its really important to me that everyone feels empowered, trusted, and comfortable to throw out crazy ideas (often the best kind of ideas). I also want to make sure I'm using my influence to support the team manager and help him succeed.

## OK, sometimes it just comes out

On the other hand, I sometimes have strong opinions. I try to be fairly gentle when expressing them, but particularly so when it has to do with team health, work management, or other areas where the team's manager is ultimately accountable. I have a personal policy that I'm allowed to share an idea or observation, but I try to limit my follow-up/advocacy for it unless the team is actively expressing interest.

Sometimes my manager colleague's curiosity might be peaked about something I shared, but had engaged my advocacy shut-off switch on. While doing some preparation for the new DevX team, we've been talking a lot about Kanban vs Scrum, optimizing for lead time, and the role of the agile coach/scrum master in day-to-day operations. He's spent most of his career doing a fairly specific flavor of Scrum, and has a mix of curiosity and skepticism about venturing away from the methodologies that have worked for him in the past.

At one point, in a moment of exasperation, he pointed out that I had a surprising level of confidence in some of my assertions... and was a bit skeptical this wasn't stemming from my actual lived experience, but a tidbit I had read in some bullshit management article. I realized at this point I hadn't told him before about where I had formed these opinions.

## Some crazy stuff went down at Vistaprint

About 3 and a half years before I left Vistaprint, I was asked to join the Engineering leadership team by our (relatively) new VP of Engineering, Erin DeCesare (who is now the [CTO of EZCater](https://www.ezcater.com/company/team/erin-decesare/)). She was a particularly bold leader in terms of her progressive management ideas, and was rapidly reshaping the organization with a strong set of values around empowerment and servant leadership.

We were responsible for about 200 developers, who were organized into squads (a.k.a. two-pizza teams), who were then loosely grouped into "tribes" (an idea borrowed from [Spotify](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify)). The real difference from the previous regime was a pretty extreme amount of autonomy given to teams; they could choose their own technologies, work processes, architectures.

On top of this, Erin was pushing farther into some even more progressive empowerment concepts. For example:

* Managers were given a lot of coaching on servant leadership, and the ones who weren't able to evolve were managed out
* Teams would be supported by embedded agile coaches, who helped them optimize team health properties, such as psychological safety and culture of feedback
* Teams were given the freedom to decide what work to pull from our enterprise backlog
* Teams would decide how to distribute bonuses between them (this one went a bit sideways)
* TODO

All this stuff was a bit mindblowing to me, but I was doing my best to be open minded about it all. It was an extraordinary amount of cat-herding, managing through influence, and general chaos. 

We rapidly iterated on organizational mechanisms to turn all this chaos into features and products that made our customers happy. We found points of leverage across teams, elevated thoughtful and visionary people, and set up structures to help make sane architectural decisions.

## Then we watched the experiments unfold

Then, things got very interesting. We had something like 30 squads, each running themselves in almost any way they saw fit. There was a lot of diversity between teams; folks with different backgrounds, different technology preferences, teams with stronger or weaker opinions, etc. What I witnessed was 30 different teams running 30 different experiments into what makes a team successful... or not.

Some examples:

* Some teams stuck conservatively to working in our monolith, and did a release every 2 weeks, others spun up Kubernetes clusters in AWS with KOPS and deployed their apps via helm charts several times a day.
* Some were absolutely religious about automated testing, and obsessive about code coverage, others had a more deliberate risk-management strategy. 
* Some teams spent a long time getting observability working, and others relied more on signals from external SRE and QA.
* Some worked via consensus and mostly made decisions together, others had one or two very senior folks which set the direction for the team
* Some teams did all their work in pairs, or via "mobbing", while others only interacted with their teammates when they were stuck.

There was also a lot of variation in the adoption of the agile philosophies we were coaching the teams into adopting. 

## Things I noticed

After running in this mode for about 9 months, there were a few themes I noticed which have really informed my perspective today:

### Moderately strong teams outperform strong individuals surrounded by a meh team

We had a few squads where 4-5 (out of 6) team members were solid "A-" or "B+" players. In contrast, there were other teams held together by one very strong "superstar" lead surrounded by "B"s and "C"s. The teams with the more homogenous, moderately strong members significantly outperformed the teams with the superstar.

The underlying cause was that the superstar would get randomized trying to support the rest of the team, and didn't have enough time to do anything innovative. If they ever did manage to spend some time on something interesting, it was generally too advanced for the team to run with, and the momentum fizzled. The rest of the team became helpless and dependent on the superstar to make decisions.

Of course, there was occasionally the more enlightened superstar, who would spend their energy trying to elevate their lower-performing team members. The effectiveness of this was highly dependent on the latent potential of the rest of the team, and usually didn't work without management injecting additional stronger engineers to support the superstar.

In general, the ratio of strong vs weak really can't dip below 2/1 before the team veered into unhealthy territory. Who knew, you need good people to have a good team.

### Strong POs are critical

We had Product Owners deployed to each squad, usually a PO would cover 2-3 squads. The difference between a great PO and a bad one was **very** stark. POs ultimately decide what the teams work on, so it seems fairly obvious that they'd have an outsized influence on the team.

At the core of the role is having great instincts about customers, the product, and the problem space, and this usually just comes down to the same observation that you need great people to build a great product. But there are other key factors which are underappreciated in POs:

* Empathy and rapport with developers
* A willingness and interest in understanding technical limitations and tradeoffs
* An understanding that they're not only responsible for the customer experience, but the long-term health of the technology it's built on

### Agile can be so powerful, or so horrible

Some teams got really religious about their agile methodology (it's Scrum adherents that do this), and used agile "rules" as a weapon against their PO, manager, or sometimes each other. They'd spend a lot more time playing games with ticket management, ceremonies, and storypoints than they did thinking about customers, products, or using their common sense.

One of the best defenses against teams going this direction was having great agile coaches (and not the high priests from big consultancies who spend their time promoting their seminars on LinkedIn). A good agile coach can provide a sort of intervention for a team, where they hold up a mirror, help them see their own disfunction, and help re-center them on what matters.

:::tip
I've noticed a correlation that great agile coaches tend to also be very product-centered, and are genuinely interested in developing technical and domain knowledge from the team they're helping. They ask a lot of questions, and develop insights that are specific to the practical limitations the team is working with. They don't just waltz in and start unloading a bunch of dogma.

Its interesting that when you see a healthy, high-performing team, agile methodologies are sort of invisible- they sort of melt away into the background. The team is just focusing on the actual work: how to meet a customer's need, what hypotheses they should be testing, finding the quickest way to answer a question with data, etc.

### The cult of test

We had a few teams that drank the TDD kool-aid **hard**. One in particular had set up their CI/CD to fail builds where the code coverage dipped below 95%, and spent about 3/4 of their time working on their test suites. The result wasn't amazing quality, it was utter paralysis. Every feature they implemented broke a gazillion tests, and the pressure to get the features out was causing them to make the tests increasingly brittle.

In this case, the intervention involved going back to the basics of why

## Looking back

I'm incredibly thankful to Erin for taking me with her on this journey- I really couldn't have had more learning jam-packed into a few short years of my life.
