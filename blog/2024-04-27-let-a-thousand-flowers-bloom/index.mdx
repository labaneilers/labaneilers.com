I've been working with a coleauge on setting up a new team at work; we're splitting a new Developer Experience team out of our pre-existing Cloud Engineering team (which I'm very excited about). He's the actual, official manager of the Cloud Engineering team (which I've been working closely with over the past couple years), and I've been a sort of guest on the team, though I'm in all the ceremonies, and try to follow the working agreements of the team. 

A few years ago, I made a deliberate decision to step away from managing teams directly, but I'm also not strictly an individual contributor. I'm pretty lucky to have a role where I'm expected to have an organization-scoped impact, without having to do peopole management. Given this outsized influence, I have to be careful not to suck up too much oxygen within my host team; its really important to me that everyone feels empowered, trusted, and comfortable to throw out crazy ideas (often the best kind of ideas). I also want to make sure I'm using my influence to support the team manager and help him succeed.

On the other hand, I sometimes have strong opinions. I try to be fairly gentle when expressing them, but particularly so when it has to do with team health, work management, or other areas where the team's manager is ultimately accountable. I have a personal policy that I'm allowed to share an idea or observation, but I try to limit the follow-up advocacy for it unless the team is actively expressing interest.

Sometimes the manager follows up with me on something I might have shared, but not followed up on. Recently we've been talking a lot about Kanban vs Scrum, optimizing for lead time, and the role of the agile coach/scrum master in day-to-day operations. He's spent most of his career doing a fairly specific flavor of Scrum, and has a mix of curiosity and anxiety about venturing away from the methodologies that have worked for him in the past.

At one point, in a moment of exhaspiration, he pointed out that I had a suprising level of confidence in some of my assertions... and was a bit skeptical this wasn't stemming from some tidbit I had read in a managagement article, rather than from actual hard-won experience. I realized at this point I hadn't told him before about where I had formed these opionions.

## Some title

About 3 and a half years before I left Vistaprint, I was asked to join the Engineering leadership team by our new VP of Engineering. She was a particularly bold leader in terms of her progressive management ideas, and was rapidly reshaping the organization with a strong set of values around empowerment and servant leadership.

We were responsible for about 200 developers, who were organized into squads (a.k.a. two-pizza teams), who were then loosely grouped into "tribes" (an idea borrowed from [Spotify](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify)). The real difference from the previous regime was a pretty extreme amount of autonomy given to teams; they could choose their own technologies, work processes, architectures.

On top of this, our VP was pushing us to introduce a series of even more progressive empowerment concepts. For example:

* Managers were given a lot of coaching on servant leadership, and the ones who weren't able to adapt were managed out
* Teams would be supported by embedded agile coaches, who helped them optimize team health properties, such as psychological safety and culture of feedback
* Teams were given the freedom to decide what work to pull from our enterprise backlog
* Teams would decide how to distribute bonuses between them (seriously)
* TODO

All this stuff was a bit mindblowing to me, but I was doing my best to be open minded about it all.
