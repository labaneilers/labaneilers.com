For most of my career, I've found that I tend to be pretty quick to develop a reputation in whatever company I'm working at. I mean, I've never been the smartest person, but I've got some breadth, some critical thinking skills, and I'm good at synthesis and communication. This has helped me see the big picture in moments where a novel idea was needed, and I was able to connect some talented people to come up with some cool stuff together.

## The small pond

Because of this, people have mostly taken me seriously within my companies. In my work as both a platform engineer as well as in engineering leadership, this has come in pretty handy. I do a lot of internal communications, mostly with developers, but also across organizations, including occasionally the C-suite, where the objective is some combination of inquiry and advocacy. For example:

* I have to convince team managers to commit some of their team's time to test out a new observability vendor and get me feedback before a purchasing deadline
* I need to convince a product owner that if their team spends some time migrating their app to our new platform, it will pay off by making their team faster and their product more reliable
* I need to convince developers they need to adopt some new front-end standards, because mobile web is actually a thing now, and we need to make sure our site works on phones (lol, this one is a bit dated now)
* I need to convince the CTO that an assumption they made isn't correct, and we need to pivot ASAP

In all these kinds of communications, I often start with writing. Not only does it help me clarify my own thoughts, but I feel like its a conscientious way to engage with someone when you're obviously trying to influence them. It gives them a chance to read, absorb, and process, without being put on the spot. Then it can be a lot easier to have subsequent conversations. This is even more so when I need to communicate out broadly to a large audience.

## My inside voice

So I ended up writing a lot of internal documentation, emails (and increasingly more multi-paragraph slacks), and occasionally some slides for a presentation. In all of these, I've found a particular voice that feels appropriately authoritative, but also approachable and informal, with a bit of self-deprecating humor, and the occasional pop culture reference thrown in.

These have always been relatively well received, and usually effective. But at some level, I've always known that a big part of this is my reputation and pre-existing standing in the company, and I'm honestly not sure how big. It's easy to be confident about my communication when I literally know a big chunk of the people in my audience personally.

## Finding my outside voice is a little scary

I've been procrastinating on starting this blog for over 15 years (I wrote my first entry a few months before my youngest child was born), and I have to admit its partially because I'm a bit nervous about leaving my comfortable little corporate bubble where everyone knows me (and perhaps some people even like me).

Part of me thinks all these "great insights" I've been wanting to share for years are going to get absolutely shredded in the daylight, given the tech world is filled with brilliant people, and on any single topic I think I know anything about, there's someone who knows a whole lot more. Perhaps I'm absolutely full of crap, or perhaps my insights are just boring and obvious.

Something changed in the past few months, and the urge to start sharing some ideas has finally overcome my fear of getting pilloried. I'm finally internalizing the truth that **I really need more external feedback**, and a chance to test out some of these crazy ideas in the open where I can get feedback from a much more diverse and knowledgeable population.

## Mustering the energy

The other part was finding the time and energy to do the technical work to get this thing up and running. My site used to be on Vistaprint's website platform (which I helped build back in the day, so it was free for me), and had since been (forcibly) migrated to Wix. Frankly, working with Wix... did not make me happy.

At work, I finally found a [static site generator](https://docusaurus.io/) that I like a lot for documentation, so that gave me the push I needed to export my stuff out of a languishing Wordpress, and get it published to Github Pages.

At some point soon I have to figure out SEO, and probably get over my disdain for social media and start putting myself out there.

## Conclusion

We all may remember, in our younger days, our teachers and parents admonishing us to use our inside voice. Perhaps it was good advice at the time. For me, though, I think its finally time to step outside.

Hopefully those mean kids next door won't throw rocks at me again.
