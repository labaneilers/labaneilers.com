I’ve been working in software since the late nineties, and I’ve been in the platform engineering space for the last 15 years. During that time I’ve also done a bunch of engineering leadership/management and architecture.

Before that, I did a bunch of different software work, including full-stack and front-end development. I built some of the earliest, large, “rich” web apps (what’s now called a SPA) back before the cool kids liked JavaScript.

I’m currently working at [SimpliSafe](https://www.simplisafe.com) as a Distinguished Engineer.
